# WeChat Red Envelopes [中文版本](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/WeChatLuckyMoney/blob/stable/README.md)

This Android app helps you snatch red envelopes in WeChat group chat. When a red envelope is detected, the service automatically clicks on it, faster than any mankind.

You are now on the [**stable branch**](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/WeChatLuckyMoney/blob/stable/README_EN.md). Please goto [**Release**](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/WeChatLuckyMoney/releases/) page to download available apk. According to our test, the stable version is capable of snatching every single red envelope. 

> **Note:** You can also switch to the [**dev branch**](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/WeChatLuckyMoney/blob/dev/README_EN.md) to find out more experimental improvements. However, the stability might not be as good as the stable one.

The following doc is targeted at **stable branch**.

## Implementation

[The document on dev branch](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/WeChatLuckyMoney/blob/dev/README.md) covers every single detail of the implementation. However, it's in Chinese and I'm not gonna do the translation.

## License

The project was heavily inspired by an [app](https://github.com/XiaoMi/LuckyMoneyTool) demonstrated on XiaoMi's news conference for its phone product this autumn. The stable branch is developed after this, while the dev branch rewrites nearly all the code.

**Note that:** This app might alter the natural way of interactions with WeChat. Thus the code is restricted to educational use only. You are *not* allowed to use it for other purposes. You must understand and be fully responsiable of the potential risks of using the app, including "being forbidden to use WeChat Lucky Money functionality", etc.
